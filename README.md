This is a python program for Contextual Spell checking
                                                                  **      Autocorrection using NLP**

Find out if a word is right spelled through Natural Language Processing algorithm

Getting Started

In this model, we are going to consider edit distance between every pair of words in a list containing the vocabulary. Basically, edit distance is a measure of minimum edits required to convert one word to another.
This process of conversion includes steps like Delete,Replace,Switch and Insert on a pair of words.

In order to do tests the Dictionary  was used to provide the vocabulary and word to train the model.

In this project, to reduce complexity, we would go for words that are 1 or 2 edit distance away.
The goal of our model to produce the right output is to compute the probability of a word being correct, P(c/w) ,is probability of certain word w given that is is correct, P(w/c) , multiplied to probability of being correct in general, P(c) , divided by probability of that word appearing, P(w) .

Formula : 𝑃(𝑐|𝑤)=𝑃(𝑤|𝑐)×𝑃(𝑐)/𝑃(𝑤)

The method used above is called Bayes Theorem.
